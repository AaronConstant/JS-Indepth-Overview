# What is a String?

In JavaScript, a **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are 
**immutable**, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. Strings can be enclosed in:

- Single quotes (`' '`)
- Double quotes (`" "`)
- Template literals (`` ` ` ``)

## String Methods and Properties

### Understanding the Difference Between Methods and Properties

Everything in JavaScript is an **object**. This will be expanded upon in later lessons. All objects 
have various **properties** and **methods**. 

So what is the difference between **properties** and **methods**?

- **Properties** are essentially key-value parts within an object. They store **data or state** about the object.  
- **Methods** are **functions attached to the object** that perform actions.

### Properties on the `String` Object

- `.length`

### Methods on the `String` Object

- `.slice()`
- `.splice()`
- `.split()`
- `.toUpperCase()`
- `.toLowerCase()`
- `.concat()`
- `.charAt()`
- `.index()`

### Example

Let's look at some examples in `./primitiveDataTypes/strings/strings.js`.
