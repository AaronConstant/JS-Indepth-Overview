# Lesson 1: What is JavaScript?

## Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. It enables developers to create dynamic websites, handle user interactions, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and build complex web applications. JavaScript is an essential part of modern web development, alongside HTML and CSS.

## Brief History and Evolution
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications. Initially developed in just 10 days, it was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. Despite its name, JavaScript is not directly related to Java. 

Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with major milestones including:
- **1997**: ECMAScript standardization (ECMAScript 1 or ES1)
- **2009**: ES5 introduced features like `JSON.parse()`, `strict mode`, and `Array.prototype.forEach()`
- **2015**: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) brought modern features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, and classes
- **Ongoing**: Regular updates (ES7, ES8, ES9, etc.) continue to improve the language with new capabilities

## Where JavaScript Runs
JavaScript runs in various environments, making it a flexible and widely-used language:

### **1. Web Browsers**
JavaScript is primarily executed in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines, like:
- **V8** (Chrome, Node.js)
- **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox)
- **JavaScriptCore** (Safari)

### **2. Servers**
With the introduction of **Node.js**, JavaScript can now run on servers, enabling backend development. Node.js allows developers to write server-side applications, interact with databases, and build APIs using JavaScript.

### **3. Other Platforms**
JavaScript is also used in:
- **Mobile app development** (React Native, NativeScript)
- **Desktop applications** (Electron.js)
- **Embedded systems & IoT**
- **Game development** (Three.js, Babylon.js)

JavaScript's ability to run both on the client-side and server-side makes it a powerful language for full-stack development.
